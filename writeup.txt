We wrote some code to access the yelp api data. Unfortunately the data was hard to get, only allowing 20 search results per query, and with no randomness to the data, you don't get any new data on multiple queries.  So getting data out of the yelp api is not as nice for a data science project where ideally you would get large amounts of data. Also the results return the best rated restaurants where we would prefer random restaurants with all different ratings. We found some problems with the api and are currently emailing a yelp employee Nick Griffin.  The api claims to support 40 requests, but only actually allows 20 when doing actual requests, we are also asking if there is a way we can get larger amounts of data.  Also the api has a problem with encoding spaces, ex. "San Francicso".

We are planning to look at the location (longitude and latitude) of crimes we get from the city of sf data and query the yelp api to give us the 10 closest restaurants.  

1. Keep track of number of times a restaurant comes up in the queries, give some information on how probable crime is near a certain restaurant.
2. Gain information about correlation between yelp ratings around a crime. We will average the restaurants around a crime to get a restaurant score assigned to that crime area.  From there we will compare that review to some sort of baseline for average restaurant ratings in San Francisco.  
3. Look at different types of crime (ie. violent vs non violent) and see how the average restaurant rating compares between them. 
4. Consider the fact of non reported crimes and how that may affect our results.

We found that several incidents in the crime data could have the same incident number which we at first assumed to be unique.  We just skipped over them because from the cases we physically looked at in the data, all the crimes were very related and had the same location. (Ex. multiple drug and narcatics charges) 

NOTES:
194080 restaurants closest to these crimes
658 unique restaurants
