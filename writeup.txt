We wrote some code to access the yelp api data. Unfortunately the data was hard to get, only allowing 20 search results per query, and with no randomness to the data, you don't get any new data on multiple queries.  So getting data out of the yelp api is not as nice for a data science project where ideally you would get large amounts of data. Also the results return the best rated restaurants where we would prefer random restaurants with all different ratings. We found some problems with the api and are currently emailing a yelp employee Nick Griffin.  The api claims to support 40 requests, but only actually allows 20 when doing actual requests, we are also asking if there is a way we can get larger amounts of data.  Also the api has a problem with encoding spaces, ex. "San Francicso".
